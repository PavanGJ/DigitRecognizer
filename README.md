# DigitRecognizer
Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms to classify input image into 10 digits (0 through 9)
Implementation involves the design and development of Logitic Regression used with (Batch )Gradient Descent Algorithm and a single-layered Neural Network along with Stochastic Gradient Descent.

#MNIST Data Set
The MNIST Data Set consists of a Training Set of 60000 samples and a Test Set of 10000 samples.
The Training Set has been partitioned to form the Validation Set which consists of about 20% of the training samples.


#USPS Data Set
The USPS Data Set consists of 19999 samples. These samples have been used as a test set.
